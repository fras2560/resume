I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Full Stack Developer position at Nuclear Promise X. With a background as a Senior Software Developer and a strong foundation in critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a more sustainable future.

As demonstrated in my resume, I am a full-stack developer with a wide range of experience. I am not opposed to specializing in the front-end or the back-end in a given position, but every team I have been a part of so far, has required skills in both domains. 

For each of my previous positions I have had to learn a new language and tech stack. This is largely due to my prioritization of the problem space rather than the tech stack. However, based upon your posting, I do have experience with React, TypeScript and Node.js. When I joined Mosaic, my experience with React was limited, yet I successfully led development of a new React application. In just 9 months, we were able to go from a rough concept to a finished product in customers' hands.

My first coop over 10 years, I had a mentor who instilled the value of testing in me. Every team that I have been a part of, my goal has always been to improve their testing process. On my first day at Mosaic, the manager supported me in establishing a testing first approach. I was able to fully set up the CI testing automation for the new application. It helped speed up velocity while still maintaining quality. My manager said it was a main contributor to delivering the application in a short timeframe and began adopting it for other projects.

I am definitely interested in working for a company that is aiming for cleaner energy. Additionally, I saw on your careers page that volunteering is a perk. Since moving to Port Elgin three years ago, I have been looking for a good volunteer opportunity similar to the ones I previously had in Kitchener. Finally, my last two jobs have been fully remote, so I am comfortable working remotely, but it would be nice to be closer to the office and other coworkers.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills can contribute positively to innovative initiatives in the nuclear industry. Thank you for considering my application.
