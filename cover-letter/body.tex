I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Full Stack Developer position at CoLab Software. With a background as a Senior Software Developer and a strong foundation in critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to better collaboration in the design space.

I am a full-stack developer with a wide range of experience. I have around 8 years' experience developing in both front-end and back-end contexts, and am eager to shift focus to wherever the product needs are greatest. I have developed expertise in many different languages.

In my past, I built on top of legacy applications but recently was able to work on a greenfield project. I successfully led development of a new TypeScript Electron desktop application with a React front-end. In just 9 months, I was able to break down the requirements into small deliverables, resulting in a product allowing the company to reach customers with IP-sensitive models. I added a CI pipeline with playwright tests that enabled myself and another front-end developer to work quickly without regressions. My manager said it was a main contributor to delivering the application in a short timeframe and I began adopting it for other projects.

In my first co-op at Validus Reinsurance I worked on a Python framework to develop internal tooling for analysts. After that I built a softball website in Flask and use the project to maintain my Python skills. The website has been running for almost ten years and used by  hundreds of different teams.

I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills can contribute positively to improving accessibility standards in the industry. Thank you for considering my application.
